                    you can find me meditating on the beach, trying local cuisines in 
                    foreign lands, or simply watching Schitt's Creek for the 4th time.</h2>

                    I've lived on the Central Coast of California for almost my entire life, 
                    excluding my time in college and graduate school. I grew up camping at the beach, 
                    playing sports, and traveling to places like Mexico and Lake Havasu with my family.

                <div class="div-2">
                    My greatest passion has got to be traveling. Nothing lights my fire more 
                    than the opportunity to experience something new. Food and culture are
                        two topics that will never cease to amaze me.

                    A little fun fact about myself is that I use Human Design when making 
                    decisions and interacting with those around me. Human Design is the 
                    energetics of a person and it has completely transformed my life.

                                    11/7/22: Worked on CardEditor page to delete cards using an OnClick function “deleteCard”
                                    <br>
                                    11/8/22: Day 2/100 - Flashcard app continued. Working on trying to get one flashcard to render 
                                    at a time. I can get all of the flashcards in the array to render but search stack overflow 
                                    for a solution to only have 1 appear at a time. [First time really diving into stack overflow]
                                    <br>
                                    11/9/22: Day 3/100 - Still can't figure out how to get one flashcard to appear at a time. Getting
                                    frustrated but hoping that after some time off tomorrow and doing more practice on another React 
                                    project, I can figure it out.
